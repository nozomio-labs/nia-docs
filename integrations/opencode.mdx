---

The Nia OpenCode plugin integrates Nia's knowledge tools directly into [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), providing automatic research triggers, context saving for cross-agent handoffs, and full MCP tool access.

<Info>
  **Automatic Detection**: The plugin detects when you need docs or research and prompts the agent to use Nia tools automatically.
