<Note>
  This guide explains how to set up Nia AI in Cursor to enhance your coding experience with Nia Agent.
  
  * ***You need a personal Nia API key to get started.***
</Note>

## Overview

Cursor is a code editor built for AI pair programming. By integrating Nia AI with Cursor, you can override the default OpenAI models with the Nia Agent, providing enhanced context-aware coding assistance.

Messages sent in Cursor will be logged in your External folder, allowing you to continue your conversations in the Nia web app.

## API Key Options

Nia offers two types of API keys for integration with Cursor:

1. **V2 API Key**: Costs 0.10 cents per request. Suitable for occasional use or testing.

2. **Cursor API Key**: Included in the Nia Pro plan ($14.99/month). Provides unlimited integration with Cursor and other tools.

Choose the option that best fits your usage needs.

## Rate Limits

All Nia API keys have a default rate limit of 60 requests per minute. This ensures optimal performance and fair usage across all users.

<Note>
  Pro plan users can request increased rate limits by contacting our support team.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key Verification Failed">
    1. Double-check your Nia API key
    
    2. Verify the base URL is exactly `https://api.trynia.ai`
    
    3. Ensure your API key has the correct permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="High Latency Issues">
    1. Expect some additional latency compared to foundational models
    
    2. This is normal due to additional context retrieval steps
    
    3. Consider optimizing your queries for more focused responses
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Model Selection Issues">
    1. Ensure you're selecting an OpenAI model (e.g., gpt-4o)
    
    2. Verify the API settings are correctly configured
    
    3. Restart Cursor if settings were recently changed
  </Accordion>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is there higher latency when using Nia AI?">
    Nia AI performs additional context retrieval steps to provide more accurate and relevant responses, which can increase response time compared to foundational models.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I switch between Nia AI and standard OpenAI models?">
    Yes, you can revert to standard OpenAI models by changing the base URL back to the default OpenAI endpoint.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Where can I find my conversation history?">
    Your conversations will be logged in your External folder and can be accessed through the Nia web app.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Which API key should I choose?">
    If you're a professional developer using Cursor regularly, the Pro plan with unlimited Cursor integration is more cost-effective. For occasional use, the pay-per-request V2 API key might be sufficient.
