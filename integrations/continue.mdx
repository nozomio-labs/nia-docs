  This guide explains how to set up Nia AI in Continue to enhance your coding experience with Nia Agent.
  
  * ***You need a personal Nia API key to get started.***
</Note>

## Overview

Continue is a powerful AI coding assistant that helps you write, understand, and improve code. By integrating Nia AI with Continue, you can leverage Nia's advanced code understanding capabilities directly in your workflow.

Messages sent in Continue will be logged in your External folder, allowing you to continue your conversations in the Nia web app.

## API Key Options

Nia offers two types of API keys for integration with Continue:

1. **V2 API Key**: Costs 0.10 cents per request. Suitable for occasional use or testing.

2. **IDE API Key**: Included in the Nia Pro plan ($14.99/month). Provides unlimited integration with Continue and other tools.

Choose the option that best fits your usage needs.

## Rate Limits

All Nia API keys have a default rate limit of 60 requests per minute. This ensures optimal performance and fair usage across all users.

<Note>
  Pro plan users can request increased rate limits by contacting our support team.
