## Choose Your Setup

There are two ways to connect Nia to your coding agent. Both give you access to the same features and tools — they just differ in how they communicate with the Nia API.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="MCP Server" icon="server" href="/integrations/installation/mcp">
    The standard approach. Your IDE connects to Nia through the **Model Context Protocol** — either via a remote server (recommended) or a local process.

    - Native IDE support for 30+ editors
    - Automatic context management
    - Remote server option (zero dependencies)
    - Best for complex, multi-step workflows
  </Card>

  <Card title="Agent Skill" icon="bolt" href="/integrations/installation/skill">
    A lightweight alternative. Your agent reads a skill file and calls the Nia API directly — no MCP server or background process needed.

    - Single command install
    - No background processes
    - Works with any agent that supports skills
    - Lighter resource usage, sometimes faster than MCP
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Not sure which to pick?** If your IDE natively supports MCP (most do), go with the **MCP Server**. If you prefer a simpler setup or your agent supports skills, try the **Agent Skill** — it uses direct API calls and can be even more responsive.
