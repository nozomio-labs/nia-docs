---

The Nia Agent Skill allows you to use Nia without running an MCP server. Instead, your agent calls the Nia API endpoints directly through the skill file, giving you a lightweight alternative to the full MCP setup.

<Info>
  **No Server Required**: The skill approach doesn't require running any background process—your agent reads the skill file and makes API calls directly.
</Info>

---

## How It Works

When you install the Nia skill, it provides your agent with:

- **API endpoint definitions** for all Nia features
- **Authentication instructions** for using your API key
- **Usage examples** the agent can follow

Your agent reads the skill file and uses it as a reference to make HTTP requests directly to the Nia API, bypassing the need for an MCP server.

---

## Installation

Install the Nia skill using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npx skills add nozomio-labs/nia-skill        # npm
pnpx skills add nozomio-labs/nia-skill       # pnpm
bunx skills add nozomio-labs/nia-skill       # bun (fastest)
yarn dlx skills add nozomio-labs/nia-skill   # yarn
```

## Setup

### 1. Get Your API Key

Sign up at [trynia.ai](https://trynia.ai) to get your API key.

### 2. Configure Your Agent

The skill will instruct your agent how to authenticate. Typically, you'll set your API key in one of these ways:

- Environment variable: `NIA_API_KEY`
- Config file: `~/.config/nia/api_key`
