This section contains practical examples and workflows to help you get the most out of Nia AI. Each example demonstrates real-world scenarios where Nia's intelligent search and code understanding capabilities shine.

## 1. Package Search & Agent Building with AI SDK

Here's Nia using package search (grep, hybrid search) and docs lookup to explore @aisdk source + docs, then building an agent in under 4 minutes:

> **Nia package search** lets you grep + search through the source of any package
>
> **Docs search** lets agents index and query any docs on the web

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Semantic code search across package source code
- Intelligent documentation querying
- Real-time agent development with context awareness
- Integration of multiple knowledge sources

## 2. One-Shot Integrations with Documentation Context

This example demonstrates how you can achieve one-shot integrations by indexing documentation. Here, Claude Code indexes Better Auth docs and codebase, then creates a complete integration in a single request.

**Workflow Highlights:**
- Index external service documentation
- Understand API patterns and implementation details
- Generate complete, working integrations
- Leverage comprehensive context for accurate implementations

## 3. Deep Research for Framework Discovery

Discover how you can use Nia deep research to find innovative frameworks, then index them for contextual development. This workflow shows the complete process from discovery to implementation.

**Research & Development Flow:**
- AI-powered discovery of relevant frameworks and tools
- Comprehensive analysis and comparison
- Index discovered resources for development context
- Build with full framework understanding
