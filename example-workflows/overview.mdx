This section contains practical examples and workflows to help you get the most out of Nia AI. Each example demonstrates real-world scenarios where Nia's intelligent search and code understanding capabilities shine.

## 1. Universal Search Across All Sources

</Frame>

Universal search lets you query across all indexed repositories, documentation, and web sources simultaneously. Instead of searching each source individually, Nia automatically routes your query to relevant sources and returns ranked results.

> **One query, all sources** - Search repos, docs, and web content in a single request
>
> **Auto-routing** - Nia intelligently determines which sources are most relevant

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Semantic + keyword hybrid search with configurable weighting
- Cross-source ranking and deduplication
- Source metadata and relevance scores
- Real-time results from repos and documentation

## 2. Package Search & Agent Building with AI SDK

</Frame>

Here's Nia using package search (grep, hybrid search) and docs lookup to explore @aisdk source + docs, then building an agent in under 4 minutes:

> **Nia package search** lets you grep + search through the source of any package
>
> **Docs search** lets agents index and query any docs on the web

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Semantic code search across package source code
- Intelligent documentation querying
- Real-time agent development with context awareness
- Integration of multiple knowledge sources

## 3. One-Shot Integrations with Documentation Context

</Frame>

This example demonstrates how you can achieve one-shot integrations by indexing documentation. Here, Claude Code indexes Better Auth docs and codebase, then creates a complete integration in a single request.

**Workflow Highlights:**
- Index external service documentation
- Understand API patterns and implementation details
- Generate complete, working integrations
- Leverage comprehensive context for accurate implementations

## 4. Deep Research for Framework Discovery

Discover how you can use Nia deep research to find innovative frameworks, then index them for contextual development. This workflow shows the complete process from discovery to implementation.

**Research & Development Flow:**
- AI-powered discovery of relevant frameworks and tools
- Comprehensive analysis and comparison
- Index discovered resources for development context
- Build with full framework understanding
