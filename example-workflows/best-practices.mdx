## Query Optimization

### Effective Search Strategies

**Be Specific and Contextual**
- Use precise technical terms instead of generic descriptions
- Include relevant context about your use case
- Specify the type of information you need (implementation, examples, troubleshooting)

**Example queries:**
- Instead of: "How does authentication work?"
- Use: "How does OAuth2 token refresh work in this authentication service?"

**Leverage Multiple Search Types**
- Start with semantic search for broad understanding
- Use grep search for specific patterns or functions
- Combine package search with documentation search for comprehensive coverage

### Query Structure Best Practices

**Progressive Refinement**
1. Begin with high-level questions to understand the system
2. Drill down to specific implementation details
3. Use follow-up queries to clarify ambiguous results

**Context Building**
- Reference previous search results in follow-up queries
- Use specific file paths or function names when available
- Include relevant error messages or specific scenarios

## Indexing Strategy

### Repository Selection

**Choose Wisely**
- Index repositories you actively work with
- Focus on well-maintained, actively developed projects
- Consider indexing both main codebase and documentation repositories

**Branch Strategy**
- Index main/master branches for stable code
- Index feature branches only when necessary for specific development
- Use folder-specific indexing for large monorepos

### Documentation Indexing

**Target High-Value Content**
- API documentation and reference guides
- Tutorial and getting-started content
- Architecture and design documents
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections

**Avoid Indexing**
- Blog posts and marketing content
- User-generated content (comments, forums)
- Frequently changing dynamic content
- Large binary files or generated documentation

## Tool Selection Guidelines

### Package Search Tools

**Use `nia_package_search_grep` when:**
- Looking for specific function definitions
- Finding exact code patterns
- Searching for configuration options or constants
- Debugging specific implementation details

**Use `nia_package_search_hybrid` when:**
- Understanding overall architecture
- Finding usage examples and patterns
- Exploring implementation approaches
- Learning how features work conceptually

**Use `nia_package_search_read_file` when:**
- Need complete context around code snippets
- Understanding function implementations
- Analyzing error handling patterns
- Reviewing complete class or module structure

### Repository and Documentation Tools

**Repository Management**
- Use `index_repository` for active development projects
- Use `search_codebase` for complex, multi-file queries
- Use `visualize_codebase` for understanding project structure

**Documentation Management**
- Use `index_documentation` for comprehensive API references
- Use `search_documentation` for conceptual questions
- Combine with repository search for implementation details

## Context Management

### Effective Context Sharing

**Save Context When:**
- Completing a complex analysis or research
- Switching between different coding agents
- Sharing findings with team members
- Creating reusable knowledge for future reference

**Context Organization**
- Use descriptive titles that summarize the work
- Add relevant tags for easy discovery
- Include key decisions and rationale
- Save intermediate findings, not just final results

### Context Retrieval

**Search Strategies**
- Use specific keywords related to your current task
- Search by tags to find related work
- Look for contexts with similar technical domains
- Reference contexts that contain relevant code patterns

## Performance Optimization

### Rate Limit Management

**Efficient Usage**
- Batch related queries when possible
- Use specific searches instead of broad exploratory queries
- Cache results for repeated questions
- Monitor usage through the dashboard

**Query Optimization**
- Start with targeted searches before broad exploration
- Use grep search for exact matches when possible
- Leverage package search for dependencies before indexing
- Combine multiple tools in single conversations

### Indexing Efficiency

**Smart Indexing**
- Index only necessary branches and folders
- Use exclude patterns to skip irrelevant content
- Monitor indexing progress and cancel unnecessary jobs
- Delete unused indexes to free up quota

## Integration Patterns

### IDE Configuration

**MCP Setup Best Practices**
- Use pipx for global installation across projects
- Configure environment variables consistently
- Test configuration with simple queries before complex work
- Keep API keys secure and rotate regularly

**Multi-IDE Workflows**
- Use context sharing to move between different IDEs
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across configurations
- Document custom configurations for team sharing

### Team Collaboration

**Shared Resources**
- Establish naming conventions for indexed repositories
- Document common indexing patterns and exclusions
- Share context libraries for common tasks
- Create team-specific documentation indexes

## Troubleshooting Strategies

### Common Issues Prevention

**Configuration Issues**
- Verify API key validity before complex operations
- Test MCP server connectivity with simple queries
- Keep installation methods consistent across team
- Document platform-specific configuration steps

**Search Quality Issues**
- Use specific technical terminology
- Include relevant context in queries
- Verify search results with source content
- Use multiple search approaches for comprehensive coverage

### Debugging Workflows

**Systematic Approach**
1. Verify basic connectivity and authentication
2. Test with simple, known queries
3. Check indexing status for relevant resources
4. Use status checking tools to monitor operations
5. Review error messages for specific guidance

**Escalation Process**
- Check troubleshooting documentation first
- Use community resources for common issues
- Contact support with specific error details
- Include relevant configuration and query examples

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Source Analysis

**Combining Information Sources**
- Use package search to understand dependencies
- Index related documentation for comprehensive coverage
- Cross-reference implementation with official docs
- Validate findings across multiple sources

**Research Workflows**
- Start with web search for technology discovery
- Use deep research for comprehensive analysis
- Index promising technologies for detailed exploration
- Document findings for future reference

### Automation and Integration

**Workflow Automation**
- Create reusable context templates
- Develop standard query patterns for common tasks
- Use project initialization tools for consistent setup
- Implement regular indexing schedules for active projects

**API Integration**
- Use direct API calls for programmatic access
- Implement custom tools for specific workflows
- Create monitoring and alerting for indexing status
- Develop custom dashboards for usage tracking
