## Building Your Own Agent

You can build similar domain-specific agents for any large codebase or documentation set:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Index Your Sources">
    Use the Nia API to index repositories and documentation:
    
    ```bash
    # Index a repository
    curl -X POST https://api.trynia.ai/v2/repositories \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $NIA_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url": "https://github.com/chromium/chromium"}'
    
    # Index documentation
    curl -X POST https://api.trynia.ai/v2/data-sources \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $NIA_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"url": "https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/"}'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search and Retrieve">
    Query your indexed sources using hybrid search:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.trynia.ai/v2/search \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $NIA_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "query": "How does the renderer process communicate with the browser process?",
        "repositories": ["chromium/chromium"]
      }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Your Agent">
    Integrate Nia search into your agent's RAG pipeline to provide grounded, accurate responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>
