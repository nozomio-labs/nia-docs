Here are some tips on how to use Nia effectively and some tricks to get better results.

## 1. When using Nia search

Ask your agent to use Nia as many times as you want and also leverage the `read_source_content` tool because each search tool outputs links where it found information from. Then the `read_source_content` tool can pick up those links and check the whole webpage or GitHub file to get the entire content if needed.

## 2. Use package search when you need information about any package

Enable your AI agents to search the source code of your package dependencies.

    Execute grep across the source code of a public package
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hybrid Search" icon="brain">
    Search package source using regex or semantic understanding
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Reading" icon="file-code">
    Read exact lines from a source file
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example queries:**
- In numpy, what environment variables or compile-time flags switch kernels, and how do you plug in a custom inner loop?
- How do I stream responses with AI SDK? Use package search.
- Search PostHog and tell me how do they handle analytics and usage monitoring.

## 3. When you start a new chat with an agent

Ask it to list docs/repos first so it can output everything you have indexed, otherwise it won't have enough context about what it has.
