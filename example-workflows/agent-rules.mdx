## Overview

People use Nia for various purposes - from deep technical research to code exploration and documentation analysis. To help AI coding agents understand and use Nia more effectively as an MCP server, we've created a collection of pre-configured rules and prompts.

## Agent Rules Repository

<Card title="Nia Rules for Agents" icon="github" href="https://github.com/nozomio-labs/nia-rules-for-agents">
  Open-source configuration files that teach AI coding agents how to effectively use Nia's capabilities.
</Card>

### What's Included

The repository provides ready-to-use configuration files for popular AI coding agents:

- **Claude** (`.claude/agents/`)
- **Codex** (`.codex/prompts/`)
- **Cursor** (`.cursor/rules/`)
- **Windsurf** (`.windsurf/rules/`)
- **Roo Code** (`.roo/rules/`)
- **Cline** (`.clinerules`)
- **General Agents** (`general-agents/`)

### Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone or Download">
    Get the configuration files from the [repository](https://github.com/nozomio-labs/nia-rules-for-agents).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Configuration">
    Copy the appropriate configuration file to your agent's directory:

    ```bash
    # For Claude
    cp .claude/agents/nia-oracle.md ~/.claude/agents/

    # For Codex
    cp .codex/prompts/nia-oracle.md ~/.codex/prompts/

    # For Cursor  
    cp .cursor/rules/nia-oracle.mdc ~/.cursor/rules/

    # For Windsurf
    cp .windsurf/rules/nia-oracle.md ~/.windsurf/rules/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Nia MCP">
    Ensure your agent has access to Nia's MCP tools. See the [Installation guide](/integrations/nia-mcp) for setup instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Using">
    Your agent now understands how to leverage Nia's research and search capabilities effectively.
  </Step>
</Steps>
