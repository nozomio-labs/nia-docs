---

<Note>
  This guide provides detailed instructions for getting started with Nia CLI, from installation to advanced usage.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before installing Nia CLI, ensure you have:

<CheckboxList>
  <Checkbox checked>Python 3.7+ installed on your system</Checkbox>
  <Checkbox checked>pip package manager</Checkbox>
  <Checkbox checked>A Nia AI account with an API key</Checkbox>
  <Checkbox checked>GitHub access for repository indexing</Checkbox>
</CheckboxList>

To verify your Python installation:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Nia CLI">
    Using pip (recommended):
    
    ```bash
    pip install nia-cli
    ```
    
    Alternatively, use pipx for an isolated installation:
    
    ```bash
    # Install pipx if you don't have it
    pip install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    
    # Install Nia CLI in isolated environment
    pipx install nia-cli
    ```
    
    <Note>
      If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before installation.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Confirm that Nia CLI was installed correctly:
    
    ```bash
    nia --version
    ```
    
    You should see the version number of the installed CLI.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    If you don't already have a Nia API key:
    
    1. Go to [app.trynia.ai](https://app.trynia.ai)
    2. Sign up or log in to your account
    3. Navigate to API settings
    4. Generate a new API key
    
    <Warning>
      Keep your API key secure. Do not share it or expose it in public repositories.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Login to Nia">
    Authenticate your CLI with your API key:
    
    ```bash
    nia login
    ```
    
    When prompted, enter your API key. Alternatively, provide it directly:
    
    ```bash
    nia login YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    
    Your API key will be securely stored in `~/.nia/config.json`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Configuration

After installation and authentication, let's set up your working environment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View available repositories">
    If you've already indexed repositories through the Nia web interface, you can list them:
    
    ```bash
    nia list
    ```
    
    This will show all repositories you have access to, including their IDs, names, branches, and indexing status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Index a new repository">
    To add a GitHub repository for Nia to analyze:
    
    ```bash
    nia create owner/repo
    ```
    
    For example:
    
    ```bash
    nia create nozomio-labs/sample-project
    ```
    
    By default, Nia will index the "main" branch. To specify a different branch:
    
    ```bash
    nia create owner/repo -b develop
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      Initial indexing may take several minutes depending on the size of the repository.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check indexing status">
    Monitor the progress of repository indexing:
    
    ```bash
    nia status REPOSITORY_ID
    ```
    
    Replace `REPOSITORY_ID` with the ID returned when you created the repository.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set a default repository">
    To avoid specifying a repository ID in every command:
    
    ```bash
    nia select REPOSITORY_ID
    ```
    
    Alternatively, run `nia select` without arguments to see a list of repositories to choose from.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Starting Your First Chat

Now that you've set up Nia CLI and indexed a repository, let's start interacting with your code:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Begin a chat session">
    Start chatting with your default repository:
    
    ```bash
    nia chat
    ```
    
    Or specify a repository:
    
    ```bash
    nia chat REPOSITORY_ID
    ```
    
    <Note>
      The chat interface will open in your terminal.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask questions about your code">
    Now you can ask Nia about your codebase. Try starting with these questions:
    
    ```
    > What is the structure of this repository?
    > How does the authentication system work?
    > Where is the main entry point for the application?
    > Explain the database schema and relationships
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      Be specific in your questions to get the most precise answers.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Explore multi-repository functionality">
    For projects that span multiple repositories, you can include additional repositories in your chat:
    
    ```bash
    nia chat REPOSITORY_ID --additional REPO_ID2,REPO_ID3
    ```
    
    This is particularly useful for microservice architectures or projects with shared dependencies.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="End your session">
    When you're finished, exit the chat:
    
    ```
    > exit
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Workflow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Working with Multiple Projects">
    If you're working on multiple projects that use different repositories:
    
    1. Create separate terminal sessions for each project
    2. In each session, select the appropriate default repository:
       ```bash
       nia select REPOSITORY_ID
       ```
    3. Start chat sessions in each terminal:
       ```bash
       nia chat
       ```
    
    This allows you to maintain separate contexts for different projects.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Re-indexing After Changes">
    When your codebase undergoes significant changes:
    
    1. Re-index the repository to ensure Nia has the latest code:
       ```bash
       nia create owner/repo -b branch
       ```
    2. Wait for indexing to complete:
       ```bash
       nia status REPOSITORY_ID
       ```
    3. Resume your chat with the updated codebase:
       ```bash
       nia chat REPOSITORY_ID
       ```
    
    <Tip>
      Re-index after major feature additions, refactoring, or architecture changes.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Environment Variables">
    For custom configurations or debugging:
    
    ```bash
    # Override API endpoint (useful for self-hosted instances)
    export NIA_API_URL="http://your-custom-instance:8000"
    
    # Enable detailed logging
    export DEBUG=1
    
    # Apply for a single command
    DEBUG=1 nia chat
    ```
    
    These variables can be added to your shell profile for persistence.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Shell Integration">
    Add these to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for enhanced functionality:
    
    ```bash
    # Nia CLI shortcuts
    alias nc="nia chat"
    alias nl="nia list"
    alias ns="nia status"
    
    # Quick repository selection
    nselect() {
      nia select "$@"
    }
    ```
    
    This allows for faster workflow with shortened commands.

## Configuration File Reference

The Nia CLI configuration file is located at `~/.nia/config.json`. Here's a sample configuration with explanations:

```json
{
  "api_key": "nia_api_key_example123456789",  // Your Nia API key
  "default_repo": "repo_abcdefg123456",       // Currently selected default repository
  "api_url": "https://apigcp.trynia.ai",         // API endpoint (can be customized)
  "user": {
    "name": "Your Name",                      // User information
    "email": "your.email@example.com"
  },
  "model_preferences": {
    "default": "claude-3-sonnet"              // Default model for chat
  },
  "terminal": {
    "colored_output": true,                   // Enable colored output in terminal
    "max_width": 100                          // Maximum width for text display
  }
}
```

You can manually edit this file if needed, but it's recommended to use the CLI commands for configuration.
