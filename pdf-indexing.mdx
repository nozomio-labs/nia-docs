## Tree-Guided Hybrid Search

Traditional RAG systems split documents into flat chunks, losing structure and context. Nia invented a different approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Document Trees" icon="sitemap">
    PDFs are parsed into hierarchical structures — sections, subsections, figures, tables — preserving the document's logical organization.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Section-Level Indexing" icon="layer-group">
    Each section is indexed with its position in the hierarchy, enabling precise retrieval that knows *where* information lives.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Hybrid Signals" icon="code-merge">
    Combines vector embeddings with non-vector signals (headers, page numbers, cross-references) for high recall with minimal context bloat.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Hierarchical Traversal" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Agents traverse documents as trees instead of scanning flat chunks, finding relevant sections faster and more accurately.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Why it matters:** High recall across large PDF corpora without stuffing context windows with irrelevant chunks. [Read the technical deep-dive →](https://www.trynia.ai/blog/tree-reasoning-pdf-search)

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Index a PDF">
    Provide an arXiv URL, paper ID, or upload directly:
    - *"Index https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345"*
    - *"Index this SEC filing"*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tree Extraction">
    Nia parses the PDF structure — sections, headers, figures, tables — building a navigable document tree.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Chat with Context">
    Ask questions and get answers grounded in specific sections, with citations pointing to exact locations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Research Papers" icon="flask">
    Index arXiv papers for literature reviews. Search across dozens of papers at once, compare methodologies, understand dense sections.
  </Card>

  <Card title="SEC Filings" icon="building-columns">
    Navigate 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and proxy statements. Find specific disclosures, compare across years, extract financial data.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Legal Documents" icon="scale-balanced">
    Index contracts, briefs, and regulations. Search for specific clauses, understand obligations, compare versions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Technical Manuals" icon="book">
    Index product documentation, API specs, or internal wikis. Get precise answers with section references.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Start

```bash
# In your AI coding agent, just say:
"Index https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345"

# Then ask questions:
"What problem does this paper solve?"
"Summarize section 3.2"
"What are the limitations mentioned by the authors?"
```

Or use the [Papers Playground](https://app.trynia.ai/playground/papers) for a visual experience.
