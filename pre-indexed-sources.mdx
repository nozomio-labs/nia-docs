## How It Works

Instead of indexing heavy frameworks yourself and waiting for the job to complete, you can subscribe to sources that others have already indexed:

1. **Browse the library** at [app.trynia.ai](https://app.trynia.ai) → Global Sources
2. **Search** for the repository, documentation, or paper you need
3. **Click to subscribe** — instant access, no indexing required

---

## Popular Pre-indexed Sources

Some of the most subscribed sources include:

- **Chromium** — Full browser codebase indexed by folder
- **React / Next.js** — Framework source + documentation
- **FastAPI** — Python web framework with docs
- **Vercel AI SDK** — AI tooling source and guides
- **LangChain** — LLM orchestration framework

<Info>
  Can't find what you need? Index it yourself and it becomes available for others to subscribe to.
