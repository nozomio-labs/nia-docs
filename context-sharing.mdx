## Cross-Agent Context Sharing

Finish planning in one agent, pick up execution in another, without losing the thread.

### Core Capabilities

Save entire conversation histories - code snippets, plans, decisions, referenced sources, and edited files. Re-open them in another chat or coding agent.

Nia preserves what you searched and every query you made.

This makes it easy to move between different agents. Plan with Cursor and continue execution in Claude Code. All your context comes with you.

### How It Works

When you save a context, Nia captures:
- Your entire conversation history
- Code snippets and files you edited
- Plans and decisions you made
- All the sources you referenced
- Everything Nia searched for you
- Every query you made

When you open it in another agent, everything is there. No context lost.
