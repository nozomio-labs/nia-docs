Save entire conversation histories - code snippets, plans, decisions, referenced sources, and edited files. Re-open them in another chat or coding agent.

Nia preserves what you searched and every query you made.

This makes it easy to move between different agents. Plan with Cursor and continue execution in Claude Code. All your context comes with you.

### Unified Context Tool

The `context` tool provides all context management operations through different actions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Action: save" icon="floppy-disk">
    Save conversation with title, summary, content, tags, and edited files
  </Card>

  <Card title="Action: list" icon="list">
    List saved contexts with filtering (workspace, directory, file overlap)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Action: retrieve" icon="arrow-down">
    Pull full context by ID
  </Card>

  <Card title="Action: search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Search by keyword across title, summary, content, and tags
  </Card>

  <Card title="Action: update" icon="pencil">
    Update title, summary, content, tags, or metadata
  </Card>

  <Card title="Action: delete" icon="trash">
    Remove contexts when done
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

All operations use the same `context` tool with different `action` parameters.

### How It Works

When you save a context, Nia captures:
- Your entire conversation history
- Code snippets and files you edited
- Plans and decisions you made
- All the sources you referenced
- Everything Nia searched for you
- Every query you made

When you open it in another agent, everything is there. No context lost.
