## What is Nia?

Nia is an API layer that provides agents with up-to-date, continuously monitored context from libraries, research papers, and technical documentation, saving you hours of manual ingestion.

It can also be used with coding agents like Cursor or Claude as an MCP server, giving them reliable external context so they don't hallucinate.
