Don't want a general-purpose MCP with dozens of tools? Create a scoped MCP that focuses on just the knowledge you need.

## What are Scoped MCPs?

Instead of using Nia's full MCP server with all tools, you can generate a specialized MCP server that:

- **Focuses on a single source** — One framework, one documentation site, one research paper
- **Has fewer tools** — Only the tools relevant to that source
- **Reduces context noise** — Your agent sees only what's relevant

---

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a Pre-indexed Source">
    Go to [app.trynia.ai](https://app.trynia.ai) and browse the Global Sources. Find the documentation, repository, or paper you want.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Scoped MCP">
    Click on the source and select "Create Scoped MCP". Nia generates a dedicated MCP configuration for that source.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to Your IDE">
    Copy the generated configuration into your IDE's MCP settings. The scoped MCP connects only to that specific knowledge source.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Vercel AI SDK Scoped MCP

Instead of querying all of Nia's knowledge, create an MCP that only knows about the Vercel AI SDK:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nia-sdk-vercel-ai": {
      "url": "https://apigcp.trynia.ai/mcp?source=https%3A%2F%2Fsdk.vercel.ai%2Fdocs",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `source` parameter is URL-encoded. For `https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs`, it becomes `https%3A%2F%2Fsdk.vercel.ai%2Fdocs`.

Now your agent has access to Vercel AI SDK documentation without being distracted by other sources.

## Popular Scoped MCPs

Some commonly requested scoped servers:

| Source | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Next.js** | React framework with App Router, Server Components |
| **BetterAuth** | Authentication library for TypeScript |
| **FastAPI** | Python web framework |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS framework |
| **Prisma** | TypeScript ORM |
| **LangChain** | LLM orchestration framework |

<Info>
  Any pre-indexed source can become a scoped MCP. If it's in Global Sources, you can create a focused server for it.

## When to Use Scoped MCPs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Scoped MCP When" icon="bullseye">
    - Working on a single-framework project
    - Want minimal tool clutter
    - Need faster, more focused responses
    - Prefer explicit control over context
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Full Nia MCP When" icon="layer-group">
    - Working across multiple technologies
    - Need indexing and research tools
    - Want to search your own repos/docs
    - Building with diverse dependencies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Multiple Scoped MCPs

You can run multiple scoped MCPs simultaneously:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nia-nextjs": {
      "url": "https://apigcp.trynia.ai/mcp?source=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs.org%2Fdocs",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }
    },
    "nia-prisma": {
      "url": "https://apigcp.trynia.ai/mcp?source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prisma.io%2Fdocs",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }
    },
    "nia-tailwind": {
      "url": "https://apigcp.trynia.ai/mcp?source=https%3A%2F%2Ftailwindcss.com%2Fdocs",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

Each MCP operates independently, giving you precise control over what knowledge your agent can access.

<Tip>
  To get the URL-encoded source, take the documentation URL and encode special characters: `/` becomes `%2F`, `:` becomes `%3A`.

## Scoped vs. Subscribed Sources

| Scoped MCP | Subscribed Source (Full MCP) |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Dedicated MCP server per source | Single MCP, multiple sources |
| Separate tool namespace | Shared tools query all subscribed |
| Best for focused workflows | Best for cross-source queries |
| Multiple MCP configs needed | One config, manage sources in UI |

<Tip>
  **Start with the full Nia MCP** if you're exploring. Switch to scoped MCPs once you know exactly which sources you need for a project.
</Tip>
