## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP configuration file doesn't exist">
    **Problem:** The mcp.json file doesn't exist in the expected location.
    
    **Solution:** You can create the file manually. The mcp.json file should be located at:
    - **macOS (Cursor)**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
    - **macOS (Windsurf)**: `~/.windsurf/mcp.json`
    - **macOS (Claude Desktop)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    - **Windows (Cursor)**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\mcp.json`
    - **Windows (Windsurf)**: `%APPDATA%\Windsurf\mcp.json`
    - **Windows (Claude Desktop)**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    - **Linux (Cursor)**: `~/.config/cursor/mcp.json`
    - **Linux (Windsurf)**: `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json`
    
    Create the directory if it doesn't exist, then create the mcp.json file with the configuration from the [installation guide](/integrations/nia-mcp#configuration-for-your-coding-assistant).
    
    Example:
    ```bash
    # For Cursor on macOS
    mkdir -p ~/.cursor
    touch ~/.cursor/mcp.json
    ```
    
    Then add the configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "nia": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": ["run", "--no-cache", "nia-mcp-server"],
          "env": {
            "NIA_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
            "NIA_API_URL": "https://apigcp.trynia.ai/"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools not showing in MCP client">
    **Problem:** After installation, the Nia tools don't appear in your MCP client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.).
    
    **Solution:** This usually happens when the MCP server isn't installed globally. Make sure you've installed using `pipx` for global installation:
    
    ```bash
    # Install pipx first if you haven't
    pip install pipx
    
    # Install nia-mcp-server globally
    pipx install nia-mcp-server
    ```
    
    Why `pipx` is recommended:
    - `pipx` installs packages globally in isolated environments
    - Tools are available system-wide
    - No conflicts with other Python packages
    - Automatic PATH management
    
    After installing with `pipx`:
    1. Update your MCP configuration to use `pipx run`
    2. Restart your MCP client completely
    3. Check if tools appear in the MCP tools section
    
    If you previously installed with `pip`, uninstall first:
    ```bash
    pip uninstall nia-mcp-server
    pipx install nia-mcp-server
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='"No API key provided" error'>
    **Problem:** Getting an error that no API key was provided.
    
    **Solution:** 
    1. Ensure you've replaced `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from [app.trynia.ai](http://app.trynia.ai/)
    2. Check that the environment variable is correctly set in your MCP configuration
    3. Verify there are no typos in the environment variable name `NIA_API_KEY`
    4. Make sure there are no extra spaces or hidden characters in your API key
    
    Example of correct configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "nia": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": ["run", "--no-cache", "nia-mcp-server"],
          "env": {
            "NIA_API_KEY": "sk-proj-abc123xyz789",  // Replace with your actual key
            "NIA_API_URL": "https://apigcp.trynia.ai/"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='"Command not found: pipx" error'>
    **Problem:** Getting "command not found" when trying to use pipx.
    
    **Solution:** Install pipx first:
    
    ```bash
    # On macOS with Homebrew
    brew install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    
    # On Windows
    pip install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    
    # On Linux
    pip install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    ```
    
    After installation, you may need to:
    1. Restart your terminal
    2. Add pipx to your PATH if not done automatically
    3. Verify installation with `pipx --version`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate limit exceeded">
    **Problem:** Getting rate limit errors when using Nia tools.
    
    **Solution:**
    - You've used your allocated requests for the current period
    - Check your usage at [app.trynia.ai](http://app.trynia.ai/)
    - Consider upgrading your plan for more requests
    - Free tier includes 3 indexing jobs and limited searches
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Indexing never completes">
    **Problem:** Repository or documentation indexing seems stuck.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Use the status checking tools to monitor progress:
       - `check_repository_status` for repositories
       - `check_documentation_status` for documentation
    
    2. Large repositories/sites may take several minutes to index
    
    3. Check for:
       - Valid repository URL (must be public or you have access)
       - Stable internet connection
       - API key has remaining credits
    
    4. Try re-indexing if the process fails:
       - Delete the failed index first
       - Attempt indexing again with correct parameters
