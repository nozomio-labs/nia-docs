### Tree-Guided Search

Nia uses the paper's structure to provide more accurate retrieval:

- **Section-aware search** — Results know which section they came from
- **PageIndex extraction** — Precise page and position references
- **Hybrid search** — Combines document tree with semantic search for better accuracy

---

## How It Works

Nia can index research papers from arXiv and make them searchable and queryable:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Index a Paper">
    Simply provide the arXiv URL or ID:
    - *"Index https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345"*
    - *"Index arXiv paper 2401.12345"*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Chat with the Paper">
    Ask questions about the paper's content:
    - *"What are the main contributions of this paper?"*
    - *"Explain the methodology used in section 3"*
    - *"What datasets were used for evaluation?"*
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare Multiple Papers">
    Index multiple papers and search across them:
    - *"Compare the approaches in papers X and Y"*
    - *"Find all papers that mention transformer architectures"*
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Start

```bash
# In your AI coding agent, just say:
"Index https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345"

# Then ask questions:
"What problem does this paper solve?"
"Summarize the key findings"
"What are the limitations mentioned by the authors?"
```

<Info>
  Research papers indexed through Nia become part of your searchable knowledge base, alongside your repositories and documentation.
