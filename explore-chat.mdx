## Use Cases

### Quick Learning

Ask questions about any technology without setting up anything:

```
"How does Next.js App Router handle data fetching?"
"What's the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?"
"How do I implement authentication with BetterAuth?"
```

### Cross-Framework Comparisons

Compare approaches across different frameworks:

```
"How does error handling differ between FastAPI and Express?"
"Compare state management in React vs Vue"
"What are the pros and cons of Prisma vs Drizzle?"
```

### Research Exploration

Query indexed research papers:

```
"What papers discuss attention mechanisms in transformers?"
"Explain the key findings from recent RAG research"
```

## Session Management

Your explore conversations are organized into sessions:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **View sessions** | Click the history icon in the explore interface |
| **Load a session** | Click on any previous conversation to continue it |
| **Delete a session** | Remove conversations you no longer need |
| **Start fresh** | Begin a new session with a clean slate |

<Info>
  Sessions are tied to your account. Switch between devices and your history follows you.

## Explore vs. MCP Search

| Explore Chat | MCP `search` Tool |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Web interface at app.trynia.ai | Works in your IDE/agent |
| Searches all pre-indexed sources | Can target specific subscribed sources |
| Visual session management | Programmatic access |
| Great for learning & exploration | Great for coding workflows |

Both use the same powerful search backend — choose based on your workflow.

## Tips

<Tip>
  **Be specific** — Instead of "how does React work?", try "how does React's reconciliation algorithm handle list updates?"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Reference context** — Follow-up questions remember the conversation. Ask "can you show me an example?" after an explanation.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Mix sources** — Ask questions that span multiple frameworks. Nia will pull from all relevant indexed sources.
</Tip>
